# About this repo
This repo contains modified example code from the [Tensorflow Tutorial 2: image classifier using convolutional neural network](http://cv-tricks.com/tensorflow-tutorial/training-convolutional-neural-network-for-image-classification/) and some annotations/examples of my own.

This is for learning purposes only. I am starting out with Machine Learning (and loving every second of it) and would love to share my thoughts with other people that may have similar questions or better solutions. 

It would be really cool if could help even one person with my commentary. Hopefully, this will be the start of a compendium of content that anyone can use to further their knowledge in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
